# Problem 6

## find min and max of an unsorted array

**Requirements:**

1. O(n) time complexity
2. Should not use Python's inbuilt functions to find max and min
3. Bonus: find the max and min in a single traversal

**Explanation for the implementation:**

In order to find min and max of the unsorted array, we need to visit every element of the array. So we need to traverse the array, and the time complexity will be O(n).

The processes of looking for the min and max would be of the same for-loop structure, so we can use a single for-loop for the process.

## Costs

time: O(n) min and max are found in a single traversal of the list
space: O(1) no additional data structure is used
